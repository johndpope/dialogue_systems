Jefferson, either take off the earring or put on a dress. I wanna talk a little about what we're trying to do here. There are many highly respected people who feel football is about preparation for life. These people are full of shit. You see, football is not like life. It's better. More exciting, more intense, more fun. In life, people are always wondering how they measure up; whether they're getting ahead or fallin' behind. In football, you know. Every week you get a chance to show what you're made of, a chance to demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor bastards who can't play this game are left to agonize about. Last year we didn't make enough of those chances. Last year everyone felt we let the school down. Fuck the school. We let ourselves down. We let down a great tradition, a 120- year-old Line of Champions. Any football program worth the name is a special brotherhood, an elite corps of warriors, a select group of knights. That first time our starting unit takes the field, the first time we huddle up; that's our inner circle, that's our Round Table. If I were an upperclassman, I'd be real nervous about my seat, cause we got some very talented new-comers this year. Guys who want a place at the Table. This is the trophy one of our freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as a Pennsylvania State High School First Team All-American. You know what this says to me? Not a god-damn thing. Everybody here was a high school All- American. Whatever any of you have done before is out the window. We're startin' over. Ground zero. The Table is empty. Are you ready? Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid. He'll be allright. Allright, move it up. Let's go, 15 yards, run the next play. Cut the necktie tackle horseshit. You think you're in some kinda highlight reel? He left you huggin' air. Target his guts. Drive right through his abdomen. I wanta see snot bubbles in his nose. I wanta see shit in his underwear.
