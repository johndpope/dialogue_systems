There's something about addiction that brings out something beautiful in a person. Addiction is pure. Addiction reduces a person to an infant. And there's nothing more pure and beautiful in the world than an infant. Hazel is no longer an adult. She's an infant and I'm the surrogate mother who provides her with much needed breast milk. It's a role that both of us have accepted and embrace. That's my girl! She's a little jumpy. Let's begin shall we? And please...

Every time someone like you shows up here the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger and they get a little bit weaker. Until the \"them\" and the \"they\" of this country run out of places to put us, to put its garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS into their cities from out of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for us.
