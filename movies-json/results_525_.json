Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body goes limp. Miranda exhales, coming back to herself. A beat. Rachel? No response. Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress him. Thank you, thank you, thank you. She glances back, makes sure no one is following her. Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror No. The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and notices the key is gone. Why are you doing this to me? A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the middle of the street. What do you want from me? No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing over her shoulder, seemingly demented: What is it you want me to do?!! A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the sound. It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on. I can't. Please, please don't make me go back in there. But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car. Bear with me, I'm just parking it out of the way so it won't look suspicious in the middle of the road -- okay. She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk. Not alone. What happened to you happened to other girls. I understand. And I'm sorry. But there is nothing I can do about it now. It has nothing to do with me. Shit. She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin. Blood already seeping from the nasty cut -- No. No. No... Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if the two versions of her are literally walking towards each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back. It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, right? Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key- chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it. Hello? She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half- light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles through it until she finds a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next to the ID Is there anybody here? Hello? The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation. Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can make out the metallic thing that reflected light before. It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are several heavy chains. Like a meat rack. And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and sees the body of the teenage girl Go away! Fuck off! She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's adrenaline at full tilt -- C'mon, c'mon, c'mon -- She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly, clinically. The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the immediate surroundings Wake up, Tracy, wake up -- Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.
