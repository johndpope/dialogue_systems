I'm sorry. The Private Investigator, too. If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel... Have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books? Young girls? As I said, the mother... To understand it, as I understood it hearing it from the mother... That is, from the mother-half of Norman's mind, you have to go back ten years... to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover. He was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died. His mother was a clinging, demanding woman... and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world. Then she met a man and it seemed to Norman she \"threw him over\" for this man. That pushed him over the thin line... and he killed them both. Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all... and most unbearable to the son who commit it. So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind. He stole her corpse... and a weighted coffin was buried. He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even \"treated\" it to keep it as well as it would keep. And that still wasn't enough. She was there, but she was a corpse. So he began to think and speak for her, gave her half his life, so to speak. At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations... at other times, the mother-half took over completely. He was never all Norman, but he was often only mother. And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed she was as jealous of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild. When Norman met your sister, he was touched by her... and aroused by her. He wanted her. And this set off his \"jealous mother\" and... \"mother killed the girl.\" After the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep... and like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed.", "docId": 452, "qSentId": 264, "aSentId": 264, "speaker1": "LILA", "speaker2": "SIMON", "movie_name": "Psycho.dial"}]
