It's wrong to hurt kids! Right, Della? The game's over. You won! You took him from me...He was only seventeen years old. And all he ever wanted to do was see the ocean. And he never saw it. No, he never got to go. They're all gone now. You know the movie \"Clockwork Orange\"? Well, they were my droogies, Della. Chances are they would of turned on me anyway, just like in the movie. None of them was real ass outlaw. No, not in the way you are. You're the real deal, lady. I was already thinking about cutting some of em loose, getting a new style posse together.

Delllaaa? There's only you and me, now. I saw a little trail of your blood back there. You must be hurt. I'm hurting too. I think you busted up my collarbone. I know you can hear me, Della. After what went down tonight, we got a special bond. May as well come out now, Della. I'll save one for you, for when you decide to come out. You're one tough bitch. And that's hot, hell yeah.

Husband, kids, security, every woman's dream, but not yours, Della. You know there ain't no such thing as security. But I'm betting you didn't really know who you were until tonight. I reckon I know what you've been dreaming about though, what you've been aching for, through all these lonely, wasted years. Blasting out of Podunk without never looking back. Feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers. Doing all the things they told you you ain't supposed to do. Taking what YOU want from life. And wasting anyone who stands in your way. Right, Della? Don't say you ain't thought about it. If it's in your blood, it's in your blood for all time. You had yourself fooled, Della. Shit, lady, you took my whole crew out with nothing but a bunch of them tools. You can't go back to your old life. No way. It's all over for that. Kaboom. Hooking up with me's about the best chance you got. I bet you're on the outs with your old man. When we pick up your kids, we can waste him if you like. I can do it.
