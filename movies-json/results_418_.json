The shipyard's closed, all the jobs at the gas works are set-asides, and by the time he drops out of school, he can barely get a job at Burger King.

I used to be one.... No, seriously, I called myself an anarchist. I stood up for the oppressed. I opposed state power. I oppose the present state because it's weak. It has been ever since the left emasculated it over Vietnam.
