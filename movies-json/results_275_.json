[{"question": "Thirty minutes late. Think she'll show? She didn't last week. She was having a guava facial.", "answer": "Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to another season of Indians' baseball. I know that it may not seem the same without Donald here this year, but I promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history. Unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that... \"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team.\" Obviously, Donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me. And I was more than showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise. God help you if I ever find out about it. Spring training begins in two weeks. Here's the list of people we'll be inviting to camp this year. I could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency. We haven't won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't even finished in the first division for 15. Obviously it's time to make some changes.
