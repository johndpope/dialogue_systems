Or did you just pick them because at the instant you saw them, you had decided to kill someone? The side door was perfect. No one could see you pick the lock. How did you know where they were in the house? It's darker tonight than it was on your night. But still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture? Did you have a little light? That would be too dangerous. I'll bet you were in the house before. So I should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company. Once again, how did you know where they were? Did you check the rooms before you found them? She had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on? And when did you bag the gun? Because even though I'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic. Was the door open or did you have to open it? Were they asleep or awake? Was the light on, or did you turn it on? Because I know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark. Too bright. What if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one? That's better... What thrill do you get by killing people? Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do you feel remorse? Probably that part of your brain doesn't exist. Do you have emotions of love or affection or joy? Or have you learned to fake them so you won't stand out in a crowd. What if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed? Which means they were open when you came into the room. If Mr. and Miss Normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you. Was that what you were angry about?

How did you know where they were in the house? It's darker tonight than it was on your night. But still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture? Did you have a little light? That would be too dangerous. I'll bet you were in the house before. So I should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company. Once again, how did you know where they were? Did you check the rooms before you found them? She had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on? And when did you bag the gun? Because even though I'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic. Was the door open or did you have to open it? Were they asleep or awake? Was the light on, or did you turn it on? Because I know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark. Too bright. What if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one? That's better... What thrill do you get by killing people? Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do you feel remorse? Probably that part of your brain doesn't exist.
