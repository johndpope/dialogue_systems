Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be some movement in the bushes. WHAT THE GHOST SEES PATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything. WHAT THE GHOST SEES PATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver. WHAT THE GHOST SEES PATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is behind him. WHAT THE GHOST SEES PATTERSON as the realization hits REDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything. WHAT THE GHOST SEES PATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do anything but this constantly circling movement.

Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, staring down at them both. REDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they might be statues. THE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them and as he does- THE GHOST, launched in mid-air and PATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates- THE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and- SAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT- THE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we", "answer": "BEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal.
