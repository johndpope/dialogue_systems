[{"question": "In 1983, when Special Forces told General Putkin that they weren't interested in his ideas...that was a lie. And when they told him they didn't have access to animals...that was also a lie. We FOCUS on the window - a shaky ZOOM taking us towards an abandoned looking HOSPITAL BUILDING half hidden by trees. The hundred goats in the disused hospital building had been secretly flown in from Central America so as to avoid customs. Special Forces weren't worried about the General hearing the goats because they'd been de- bleated. The GOATS stare at us, their mouths silently opening and closing. This is the story of those goats. We CLOSE ON the unblinking EYES of one GOAT, then... My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me back in Michigan, where I was born and raised. I studied journalism at Western in Kalamazoo and then I got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram. I wrote a lot of stories about competitive food eating contests. He looks at the photograph of his wife Debora on his desk and up to where she stands, photocopying in DAVE the Editor's office. Dave is chatting to her. He has a PROSTHETIC ARM. Bob watches his wife, smiling. This is Ron. Ron suddenly pitches violently forward, thudding face- first into his desk. He's the man who died. My wife, Debora, told me later that Ron's death had been like a wake-up call for her - what people used to call a memento mori. Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead man's desk. He notices a large INDENTATION on the leather in front of him - the mark left by Ron's forehead. He touches it, fascinated. That massive coronary had reminded her that life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness. Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk. His eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in Dave's office. BOB'S P.O.V - Debora's hand BRUSHES against Dave's, LINGERS just a fraction too long. Bob frowns. A week after the funeral she left me for my editor. It seemed like such a tragedy at the time. We couldn't see beyond our little lives to the great events of history unfolding out there in the world. JUMP CUT to Dave holding Bob in a head-lock with his one good arm. Debora is sitting, head in hands. I was like a child. Or a Hobbit, safe in the Shire. JUMP CUT to Bob alone in the trashed room, exhausted and drunk, watching Bush's STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH on TV. Or a blonde farm boy on a distant, desert planet, unaware that he was already taking the first steps on the path that will lead him inexorably towards the heart of a conflict between the forces of Good and Evil. Had I known where that path would lead, had a soft wind from my future brought me the name of Bill Django, I might never have gone. But as it was, I did what so many men have done throughout history when a woman has broken their heart... I went to war. We hear the opening of a period song as we... Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't lie to you Debora - it's been pretty damn hairy. Yeah, it's not, uh... I've seen things that you shouldn't, you know... He shakes his head sadly. Pretty damn hairy. Oh, that's, that's... He BEATS his head off the wall for a moment. Okay. Gotta go. We're moving out - heading up north to cover the fighting there... Yeah. They laugh. Yeah, I think they didn't want me going over because I'm not embedded. So what's a useful phrase? What's that mean? DeWitt Resources. Arkansas. You over here for the conference? Looking for a contract right? What's your pitch? The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN Bob Wilton. Could I bum a smoke, Skip? Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously. I sat there watching those reporters and realized I didn't want to be me anymore. I wanted to be them. I wanted to face peril and stand witness to the fall and rise of nations. Suddenly the TERRACE LIGHT above them flickers and goes out. Lyn and Bob sit in the dark. Everyone gets everything he wants. Like the man said. I wanted a mission. Oh crap, can't find my... A LIGHTER ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the lower half of his face, his eyes hidden by the brim of the cap. Bob leans forward to light his cigarette and finds himself staring at the CONFERENCE I.D Lyn has pinned to his shirt. The name on the badge reads LYN S. And for my sins, Fate brought me one. He stares at the name as he puffs on the cigarette, vaguely troubled by a memory.", "answer": "This is the home learning course we're putting out, which is very popular. Then there's the seminars.
