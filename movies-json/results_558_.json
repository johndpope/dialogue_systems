He is an anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who mingles with thousands of others who resemble him. We find him everywhere Go ahead, Martin. Here is some film taken by the police. The cameras were hidden at the Casbah exits. They thought these films might be useful, and in fact they are useful in demonstrating the usefulness of certain methods. Or, at least, their inadequacy. I chose these films because they were shot in the hours preceding some recent terroristic assaults. And so, among all these Arabs, men and women, there are the ones responsible. But which ones are they? How can we recognize them? Controlling documents is ridiculous Note the intuition of the cameraman. He realized that in that box, there had to be something of interest, and he paused to focus it. Maybe the bomb was hidden right there, in a double bottom. Who knows? We'll never know. That's enough, Martin ... We must start again from scratch. The only information that we have concerns the structure of the organization. And we shall begin from that ... It is a pyramid-like organization divided into a series of sectors. At the top of the pyramid is their General Staff. The military commander responsible for the executive body finds the right man and nominates him to responsibility for a sector Now number two and number three choose, in their turn, two men each ... number four and five, and so on ... The reason for this geometry is so that every militant will know only three members in the entire organization To know them means to eliminate them. Consequently, the military aspect is secondary to the police method. I know we are not fond of this word, but it is the only word that indicates exactly the type of work that we must perform. We must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid. The reason for this work is information. The method is interrogation. And interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result, or rather, an answer. In practice, demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence. I am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly. However, success does not depend solely on us. We need to have the Casbah at our disposal. We must sift through it ... and interrogate everyone. And here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative, as if Algiers were a holiday resort and not a battleground. We have requested a carte blanche. But it is very difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention, and make it possible.
