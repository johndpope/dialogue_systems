I was just what I was. I felt so free. Do you understand what I'm saying? Birds and squirrels and rocks and trees didn't seem to judge my hair. I felt at peace when there were no humans around. I figured out a way to spend as much time as possible with no people around. I became a nature writer. Last night I almost died on this mountain top, and the irony is I had never felt more alive. I knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater, forced casual. It turned the sky a queer shade of green. A green that said \"watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell.\" I could've hightailed, but that would be cheating. Part of the Nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in the face of it. As Nietzsche said, what does not kill me makes me stronger, and that goes double if you're a woman. I became a successful nature writer. Then I became a famous nature writer. I said to myself, fuck humanity... ...and I became a recluse. I had a menagerie of animals at my house. They loved me because I was me. They loved me on the days I shaved. They loved me on the days I didn't. For a while this was enough. By the time I was thirty I was very, very horny. I had to have a man in my... life. At any cost.
