Shut the fuck up and listen. Take a deep breath. Relax. Close your eyes. You're sitting at your desk... it's in the middle of a pine forest. Wind cool and light, the sun shining down through the trees. You're beside a stream, water rollin' over the rocks into the most beautiful pool of deep, green water you've ever seen... Cahill's breathing slows, his face beginning to relax. Cappy closes his eyes. ... You get up from your desk and walk to the pool, your fly rod in your hand, royal coachman tied on, your can't miss fly. At the back of that pool is Bad Leroy Brown, fifteen pound German trout, just startin' to rise from beneath a tangle of logs. Now, all you got to do is pull back, float your line out, lay that fly down like a feather, right in front of old Leroy's nose... Cahill opens his eyes. His hand has stopped shaking.

Cahill unfolds a small tripod, supporting a shaft with a suction cup at one end. He places the tripod over the sphere gently pressing the suction cup over the cover. Now back off, just a hair.

Cahill slowly removes the cover, revealing the interior of the hollow sphere, at the bottom of which is a tiny brass armature situated above a steel contact point, similar to that in an automobile distributor.

Don't think Mr. X expected us to get this far. But you need something thin and non- metallic to slip between those points. Cahill searches through the kit but can't find anything plastic. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out a handful of cocktail napkins, paper, etc. He finds a plastic coffee straw. Slitting the straw with a knife he holds it out, ready to insert it between the points. Cahill turns back to the sphere with the plastic strip, taking a deep breath. But suddenly he stops.
