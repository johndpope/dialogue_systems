Someone intelligent, of course. Kind. Pretty I suppose. But its not critical. Someone with a sense of humour. Someone you can communicate with on the same level. Someone you can really talk to. I think communication is key. I think that by the time most people turn thirty they know where they're going. And where they've been. I suppose they have some baggage stroke history.
