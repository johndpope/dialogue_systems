We have just dynamited the hatchway and are the first human beings to step foot into this vault in over a hundred years. Somewhere in here lies the secret of the great beast within us all. A beast built on lies, corruption, and greed. And there it is! The legendary beast Mocra. We've got to get out of here quick and re- secure the hatch while we make a plan of how to kill the beast. Well, it looks like we've succeeded - - at least for the moment, in sealing the beast back into the vault. Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics Once again, your humble reporter Chris McCandless. Pay no attention to the voices behind the curtain. Ted! We've got a monster in the vault. It represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all. I must slay it. Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the only one who knows. You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing! I look like some kind of an idiot. That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed. Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed. This is the only thing that can kill the monster. It's gonna be risky but without great risk, there is no freedom. So we will now hear from the famous singer - Chris McCandless.", "answer": "When we were little, Chris was very to himself. He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends. He could be alone without being lonely. The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young. It seemed like they never fought without us. I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce. They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with. I cried my eyes out. But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius NASA enlisted to do designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us. I think this is when Chris began to see \"careers\" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives. He'd begun planning to \"slay the beast\"...to make himself free.", "docId": 643, "qSentId": 6, "aSentId": 6, "speaker1": "CHRIS", "speaker2": "CARINE", "movie_name": "Into-the-Wild.dial"}, {"question": "I need a name.", "answer": "Toward the end of June, Chris had mailed our parents his final grade report.

Chris had never had a phone, so they decided to drive down to Atlanta and surprise him. CUT TO: When they arrived at the apartment, there was a \"For Rent\" sign in his window, and the manager told my parents that Chris had moved out at the end of June. When they got home, I had to hand them all the letters they had sent Chris that summer which had been returned in a bundle. Chris had instructed the post office to hold them until August 1st so that mom and dad wouldn't know that anything was up. Some part of me understood what he had done. That he had spent the previous four years fulfilling an absurd and onerous duty in graduating from college. And now, at last he was unincumbered. Emancipated from the stifling world of parents and peers. Abstraction, security, and material excess. Those things that cut Chris off from the raw truth of his existence.

My father had humbled dramatically. And what had always been a sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man who actually thought he could cancel Christmas, had given way to the vulnerability of a father's heart. Even their faces had changed. It made me sad that I couldn't share with Chris the new closeness I felt toward our parents. I close my eyes at night sometimes and imagine where Chris might be. Was there beauty around him? Was he hurt? Was he alone? Was he having the great adventure that he wanted? Could he feel the changes here at home? By some kind of supernatural osmosis? Chris once wrote to me from college saying he wanted to talk to me about all the problems he had with mom and dad. He said I was the only person in the world who could've possibly understood what he had to say. In those silent moments, with my eyes closed trying to picture where Chris might be at that very moment, probably climbing some scary mountain, I want to reach into that picture and bring him back to see what mom and dad, what our family might become. But instead when I open my eyes, what I see is my mother, sitting at the dining room table, sifting through photo albums and pictures of Chris. It's all she can do to examine the snapshots. And, though she breaks down from time to time, she studies them with a sort of hungry intensity - like looking at food you can't eat, or into a window at a family around a table that you were once a part of and can be no more. She convinces herself it's Chris; that it's her son, whenever she passes a stray. And I fear for the mother in her... Instincts that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure - I begin to wonder if I do understand what Chris is saying any longer. But I catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents he grew up with. That in the forced reflection that comes with loss, indeed everything Chris is saying, has to be said.
