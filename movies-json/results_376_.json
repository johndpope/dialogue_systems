One of the greatest heists of the 20th Century. The primary market was Africa. Eleven major conflicts involving 32 countries in the past decade - a gunrunner's wet dream. My best customer was self-declared president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste. Even though we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet him again. He'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him. His seven-year civil war has been described as \"a relentless campaign of sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of man's capacity to visit the abyss.\" That kind of sums up Andy for me. Thank him but I have other business. A busy schedule. What do you know? My schedule just freed up. But if I thought I was scared of Andre Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior. Like father, like son. The guava doesn't fall too far from the tree. He was a heavy- drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast American automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the streets of the capital. Oh yes, he was also a cannibal. They say Andre would eat a victim's heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength. I could've told him he'd get the same effect from a pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli. Monrovia itself was like being on another planet. Planet Monrovia. From the temperature it was obviously a planet close to the sun. I rarely saw another white man even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the \"Little Kremlin\". And I never left town alone. Outside town, was the edge of hell. I didn't want to even gaze into it. Part One, Two or Three? The M60. You want the attachable grenade launcher? In the most AIDS infested region of the globe, where one in four is infected, Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and no condom within a hundred miles.
