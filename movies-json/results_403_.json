But if there was one thing I knew after all my years as a journalist covering politicians, celebrities, and sports heroes, it was this -- The 'facts' -- and public perception of those 'facts' -- frequently bear little resemblance. Onscreen -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives way to the fierce joy of his playing. He slashes a ball up the alley, turns first and never hesitates at second, and as the relay comes into third -- One thing was beyond argument -- he was the most brilliant athlete of his time... perhaps of any time. I was determined to find out who was the real Ty Cobb. Cobb slides with spikes high and a cloud of dust. There is something thrilling and terrifying in the image. CUT TO: They said Cobb owned property all over the country, but in recent years had been staying in his hunting lodge at Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevadas. Driving into the Sierras at night with winter coming on wasn't the smartest decision I'd ever made but it seemed better than being late for my first meeting with Cobb.

I'm up in the woods somewhere on assignment... Listen, sweetheart, listen -- nobody can love you the way I love you and I want you to take me back. I made a mistake. Okay, lots of mistakes. I know I'm not worthy. Honey? Sweetheart? Baby? I confess I was looking forward to seeing Cobb and being near his brilliance. My own life seemed on hold, somehow. Everyday churning out the same old articles, drinking at 4 in the afternoon with the same old guys, the same old excuses for not writing a novel, the same old confused marriages that we all needed and were trying to get out of at the same time...
