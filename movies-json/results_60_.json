[{"question": "I have a theory about how this all started... Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL? Where did that rumor start? Because moms have been spreading it for years. Do you understand what this means? We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood. Then, as we get older, we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same... Why do we say this stuff to each other? Why do we tell each other these lies? Is it possible that it's because we're too scared, and it's too hard, to say the one obvious truth that's staring everyone in the face?
