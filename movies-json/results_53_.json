I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out another one. I think \"Invisible Touch\" is the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christie, take off the robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you dance a little? Take the lyrics to \"Land of Confusion.\" In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political authority. \"In Too Deep\" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Against All Odds.\" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. But I also think that Phill Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and I stress the word artist.
