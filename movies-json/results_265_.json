Even if it's just banging its head against a rock. Seems to be some natural urge... to get away for a while. I've had it for as long as I can remember. The first place I wanted out of was home... I thought I had the best parents in Bald Knob, West Virginia... till I was seven years old and got a look at some others. They weren't bad folks... ...but they were real unhappy about being who they were... It made no sense that school came easy for me... I didn't do much work, and there was a proud tradition in my family of being really dumb. My friends didn't like it much. It made them distrust me... On the other hand, it made some of my classmates like me better... I don't know what it was in me, maybe some genes from my mom, maybe some discomfort with myself, but early on I was drawn to any substance that made me numb... When I got a scholarship to go out of state to college, I was the first one in my extended family who'd gone beyond high school. At graduation, my folks looked like a normal, happy couple, which I guess they were about 10% of the time... out in public. My roommate was from a planet I had never heard of called Scarsdale, where everything was the opposite of West Virginia... All the other kids, in fact, seemed to know things I didn't. They were friendly enough, but in four years, I never got over feeling that I had sneaked in... and was about to be exposed as the hillbilly and imposter I actually was. The thing that always made those feelings go away was... fun. Fun was drugs, fun was sex, fun was aggressively doing nothing. The only problem I had with degenerate, self- destructive behavior was... I couldn't get enough of it. All that fun eventually had an impact on the work I was doing. I figured, what the hell, it was only college, after all. I'd straighten up when I went out in the real world... I didn't want to jump into my career right out of college. And since I had no career, that turned out to be not much of a problem... I had a series of challenging jobs over the next few years... ...pizza delivery, pipe fitting, pest control... lots of jobs that started with the letter \"p\". For some reason, I kept losing these jobs. The only mind-altering substance I never had a problem with was alcohol. I never got drunk. I didn't like the feeling. But really, when you're as fucked up as I was... big deal. Eventually, doing all these different jobs, I noticed something. For some reason, probably because I was too stoned to talk, everywhere I went -- -- people would talk to me, tell me everything... their stories, their problems, their innermost thoughts. Sometimes they'd pretend they needed advice, but mostly people just wanted someone to listen. Anyway, one day I was spraying for termites when I had a vision -- -- it was time to put my college degree to work and get a job with a desk. I took the civil service exam and found myself working at the Internal Revenue Service, District 14, Central Administrative Office. I started off as a general records clerk... I guess the standards weren't too high there, because my superiors got excited and pushed me to take the advancement tests... One guy in particular thought I should be a Revenue Officer. There was more money to be made as your classification went up. Which had a lot of appeal to me... ...since, even though I was certain I could stop anytime I wanted, I had developed a real affection for cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I had ever had. But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue Officer, where you were face to face abusing -- and getting abused -- all day long... ...And being a Collection Agent was definitely not in my genetic make- up...

He'd make the case and the Collection guys would come in and clean up. Our specialty was... sleazy skulking... We were a good team. I was a dope addict and Gregory was insane.

That meant the revenue officers had to use all their \"collection tools\" -- seizures, liens, levies -- even if a more reasonable compromise could have been worked out. The best way to reduce resistance from the taxpayers was to build a convincing case -- whether there'd actually been a violation or not... That's where we came in. Our DM was a particular sonuvabitch, and he knew just how to get Gregory crazy. So several things were working on Gregory when we started building a case against a furniture maker named Edmond Worrell... ...and his family. Gregory was acting more and more irrational. We started doing things that were over the line even for the IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm sure Gregory must have known about Candy and me. On our team, I had become... ...the responsible one. Sometimes when a case didn't work out right, Gregory and this Revenue Officer named McLure would put the squeeze on the subject's accountant... There aren't many accountants who don't have something to worry about with the Service... The parties met repeatedly over a period of months. The IRS offered to settle for a sizable but, they said, fair amount. Worrell said he'd done nothing wrong and threatened to fight it all the way to Washington. He seemed pretty strong. I was secretly pulling for him. McLure and the District Manager stepped up the pressure. What none of us down at the Service knew was that Edmond Worrell had a story too... Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years. Under the heat of the investigation, he fell off his medication. One Tuesday morning, he went down to the factory early, wrote his family a letter, then used the 9mm automatic they kept there to kill himself... The DM dropped the case that day and started proceedings to get rid of Gregory... Gregory went home drunk, beat up Candy and went out to drink some more. Candy told me she didn't want to see me again. She hated us both and she was leaving us both... It made perfect sense to me. I felt the same way... ...In fact, I was jealous of Candy.
