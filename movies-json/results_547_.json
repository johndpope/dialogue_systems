[{"question": "Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you, sweetheart? It's the morning here. In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary. Today begins my 154th week on Selene. I officially have two weeks to go before I climb into that Return Vehicle... And blast home. I never dreamed I'd make it this far. There were times, as you know... ...when I thought I was going to crack up. But I think I've come out the other side now. In many ways, this place is all about contradictions. It's bleak, it's beautiful. It's barren, yet filled with riches. The earth is thousands and thousands of miles away, but sometimes looks so close I feel like I could reach out and snatch it with my hand. I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm never alone... Because I have you. And I have Eve. I don't take you guys for granted. You know that now. Please kiss Eve for me.

By the time this message reaches you it should be in transit. Otherwise, everything running smoothly. There was a discrepancy between a couple of the N3000 modulators a couple of days ago, but Gerty and I caught it in time, no big deal. Uh...how are things down there?
